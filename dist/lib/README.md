#HOW TO RUN PYTHON WITH LIBWSCDRONE

* enter a dir with libwscDrone.so compiled using the makefile and source files off of branch rm/pyBebop_monolith_oldwscDrone
* ensure that CppPyBebop_IF.py has the appropriate references to functions and files found in libWscDrone
* make sure that all dependencies are met, 
	* this will involve running the opencv build partial script from within libraries/opencv-3.4.6 do this early as it takes a long time to compile
